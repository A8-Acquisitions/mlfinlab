Triple-Barrier and Meta-Labelling
=================================

The primary labeling method used in financial academia is the fixed-time horizon method. While ubiquitous, this method
has many faults which are remedied by the triple-barrier method discussed below. The triple-barrier method can be
extended to incorporate meta-labeling which will also be demonstrated and discussed below.
