Data Structures
===============

When analyzing financial data, unstructured data sets, in this case tick data, are commonly transformed into a structured
format referred to as bars, where a bar represents a row in a table. mlfinlab implements tick, volume, and dollar bars
using traditional standard bar methods as well as the less common information driven bars.
